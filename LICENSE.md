**Data:** The toy dataset included in this repository is derived from a [dataset](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/tree/gh-pages/data) 
that is Copyright [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), 
under the MIT license. It has been modified here to include only the 
`inflammation*.csv` files from the original dataset.

**Code:** Some of the code in this repository is derived from examples included in 
the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) Python [lesson](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/blob/gh-pages/06-func.md). The `detect_problems()` and `analyze()` functions are simplified in this work, but 
contain nearly identical functionality as in their original implementation.
